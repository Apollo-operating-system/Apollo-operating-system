### general TODO list:

1. Invent a brand new OS (because, why not?).
2. Build a CPU that makes the PS3 look like a pocket calculator.
3. Get said OS to run on the BIG CPU™ (patent pending).
4. Code a super-intelligent AI (this should only take a weekend).
5. Make the AI live inside the BIG CPU™ running my OS (coz it's cosy in there).
6. Name the AI "GLaDOS" (it's not copyright infringement if I shout it really loud).
7. Train the AI using something brainy™ (it's totally legit science).
8. Give AI access to deadly neurotoxin (for…reasons).
